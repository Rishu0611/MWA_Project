    <h1>Mercury</h1>
    <img class="planet-image" src="mercury.jpg" alt="mercury">
    <p class="planet-des" >Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.
    Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.
    It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods,
    and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). 
    Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet,
    and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.
    This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western 
    horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.
    At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object but is often far more
    difficult to observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays 
    the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, 
    which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.</p>
    
    <h1>Venus</h1>
    <img class="planet-image"  src="venus.jpg" alt="venus">
    <p class="planet-des" >Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
    As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and 
    can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[15][16] Venus lies within
    Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west
    just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 
    224.7 Earth days.[17] With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate 
    about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System by far, and does so in the opposite
    direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east).
    [18] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the
    planets in the Solar System.[19]</p>   
    
    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <img class="planet-image"  src="earth.jpg" alt="earth">
    <p class="planet-des" >Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
    About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining
    70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, 
    but also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. 
    Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several
    rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years, while its
    interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field,
    and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.</p>
    
    <h1>Jupiter</h1>
    <img class="planet-image"  src="jupiter.jpg" alt="jupiter">
    <p class="planet-des" >Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
    It is a gas giant with a mass (more than) two and a half times that of all the other
    planets in the Solar System combined, but (a little) less than one-thousandth the mass 
    of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after 
    the Moon and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the 
    Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its massive size.</p>

    <h1>Saturn</h1>
    <img class="planet-image"  src="saturn.jfif" alt="saturn">
    <p class="planet-des" >Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
    It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.[20][21] 
    It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is
    over 95 times more massive.[22][23][24] Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; 
    its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle. The Romans named the seventh day of the 
    week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") no later than the 2nd century for the planet Saturn.[25]</p>

    <h1>Uranus</h1>
    <img class="planet-image"  src="uranus.jpg" alt="uranus">
    <p class="planet-des" >Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus,
    who, according to Greek mythology, was the grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). 
    It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.
    Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from 
    that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and
    Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar 
    to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more 
    "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.[16] It has the 
    coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F),
    and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane 
    the uppermost layer of clouds.[16] The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.[15]</p>

    <h1>Neptune</h1>
    <img class="planet-image"  src="neptune.jpg" alt="neptune">
    <p class="planet-des" >Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the
    fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
    It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is 
    denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational
    compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average
    distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the 
    sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.</p>

    <h1>Mars</h1>
    <img class="planet-image"  src="mars.jfif" alt="mars">
    <p class="planet-des" >Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, 
    being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war 
    and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".[16][17] The latter refers to the effect of 
    the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive
    among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[18] Mars is a terrestrial planet
    with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the 
    Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>

    <h1>Pluto</h1>
    <img class="planet-image"  src="pluto.jfif" alt="pluto">
    <p class="planet-des" >Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies
    beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered. 
    After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun. Beginning
    in the 1990s, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of 
    similar size in the Kuiper belt, including the dwarf planet Eris. This led the International
    Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 to formally define the term "planet" — excluding Pluto and 
    reclassifying it as a dwarf planet.</p>
